Early trial of a user database designed to store user's gender and top 5 strengths, given by the Gallup StrengthsFinder test (not my own). Previous users are added from userData.txt, and new users added will be appended to this file.

The database may be search to find all users who have a given strength.

For those who do not know which strength they would like to find, there is a matchmaker mode. This mode allows the user to enter any number of preferences, with a preference being a person whose personality they gravitate towards. Common strengths among these preferences will be found, and the program returns all users who share these strengths.
